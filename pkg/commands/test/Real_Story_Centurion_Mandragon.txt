*chuckles* There was no king by the name of Centurion Mandragon! I can tell you the story of someone I served a long time ago,  a young half-dragon maiden who claimed to be the daughter of Athaldar, the Immortal King.

She came from far away lands, seeking to set the kingdom straight, by martial power and her own code of virtues. The traditions being the way they are in these lands, no one would accept a Queen to rule them, so she posed as a man. She was so powerful everyone compared her strength in battle to that of a hundred men. It was not long before they called her THE Centurian Man-Dragon.

To keep the appearances going, she even chose a wife... one she though was good to trust, but the truth is, this woman's true intentions were to destroy her.

Being a half-dragon made things hard enough for men to be interested in her, as dragons were so feared and hated at that time. On top of that, this woman would not let any man approach Sarina... that was the half-dragon maiden's name. She didn't want Sarina to have any children, she wanted her to die without leaving a single heir.

But as it was to be expected, finding love was inevitable no matter how many obstacles were in the middle. There was a man this woman had no way to keep away from Sarina... He was a strong and skilled warrior, he admired and loved "his king" so much he would give his life for "him" without hesitation. It was not long before she developed strong feelings for him, and he managed to see through Sarina's disguise.

The fire of their love burned stronger in the shadows, and during war campaigns, when they could spend time together, away from Sarina's "wife". But the treacherous woman would not stay arms crossed while this happened, so it was not long until she devised a way to keep the Champion Knight away from Sarina: "I need a bodyguard", she said one day. "You can't assign just any bodyguard to me, it has to be someone you trust... I want your champion knight to protect me, I deserve no less than that."

It was not long before the woman used magic to control her bodyguard's heart and mind. Sarina was then pregnant, and when she needed her champion's love the most, what she received instead was the news that he no longer loved her, he was deeply in love with the putative wife...

Sarina's heart was broken... the two traitors left, stealing an important magical item of Sarina's, a magical scabbard blessed by her mother, one that would always protect her from death.

The woman's true identity was that of a red dragon. She came back to fight the heart-broken and unprotected Sarina. Her champion knight away, still under her spell. But the scabbard, which was a link to Sarina's mother, would not just stay still doing nothing... it freed the champion from the control spell.

He rode as fast as he could to the site of the battle, only to find Sarina mortally wounded. In her last moments, she saw her champion desperately fighting to protect her. He drove the dragon away, but it was too late to save Sarina. He cried as loud as his lungs permitted him... but not everything was lost, for the baby was still alive inside her. He cut her open to take the baby out.

In the following days, with help of Sarina's mother, he built a tomb for her. Sarina's mother had the power to return her to life, but would inherit a curse. Her champion didn't want Sarina to live a cursed life, so he rejected the offer. No one knows what became of the champion or Sarina's child after that...
